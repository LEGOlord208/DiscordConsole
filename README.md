### Install

To get started, simply [download the console from releases](https://github.com/LEGOlord208/DiscordConsole/releases).

Or compile it yourself: `go get github.com/legolord208/DiscordConsole`, you'll also need the DiscordGo development version; to get that type `make dgo`. Then, actually make the switch to develop: `git checkout develop`. Finally, just type `go install`.

### Usage

It is recommended to run DiscordConsole in a Terminal. To do that, just `cd` to the folder you extracted it and run it by typing `DiscordConsole`. There are a few launch options covered in the wiki. [Click here to go to the unfinished Wiki.](https://mnpn03.github.io/DiscordConsole/wiki.html)

When starting the DiscordConsole from Windows, you might get a screen saying that Windows SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Just click the **More Info** then **Run anyway**.

Once started, you'll get asked to fill in your token. If you don't know how to get it, check [this wiki page](https://mnpn03.github.io/DiscordConsole/wiki.html).
For the first setup, we will use an user account. Setups with bot accounts and webhook are explained on the [wiki](https://mnpn03.github.io/DiscordConsole/wiki.html) as well.

Once you got your token, just type `user TOKEN` in the terminal. You'll get the following screen:
